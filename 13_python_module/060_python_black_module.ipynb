    "## Black: The Uncompromising Python Code Formatter\n",
    "\n",
    "Black is a popular and opinionated Python code formatter that automatically reformats your code to adhere to a consistent style. Unlike linters like Pycodestyle (which _check_ for style), Black _modifies_ your code to conform to its predefined style.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory Behind Black:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Opinionated Formatting:** The core principle of Black is its **uncompromising** nature. Instead of offering numerous configuration options for style, Black enforces a single, consistent style based on PEP 8 but with its own specific interpretations and choices. The idea is to eliminate discussions about code style and allow developers to focus on writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **PEP 8 as a Foundation:** While opinionated, Black's style is largely aligned with PEP 8. It respects many of PEP 8's guidelines, such as line length (default 88 characters), indentation, and basic spacing. However, it makes its own decisions on aspects where PEP 8 offers flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Manipulation:** Black parses your Python code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It then manipulates this AST to reformat the code according to its style rules. This approach ensures that the reformatting is syntactically correct and preserves the meaning of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Idempotency:** Black is designed to be **idempotent**. Running Black multiple times on the same code will result in the same output. This is crucial for automation and integration into workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Focus on Readability:** Black's formatting choices are driven by a desire to improve code readability and reduce visual noise. It aims for a consistent and predictable layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Eliminating Style Debates:** By adopting Black, teams can largely eliminate time spent discussing and enforcing code style in code reviews. The formatter handles these details automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Aspects of Black's Style:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Black aims for a consistent style, here are some notable aspects of its formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Line Length:** Defaults to 88 characters (configurable via `--line-length`).\n",
    "- **String Quotes:** Prefers double quotes (`\"`) for string literals, but will normalize to whatever is already most prevalent in the file or project.\n",
    "- **Trailing Commas:** Encourages trailing commas in function arguments, list/tuple/set literals, and dict literals, as this makes version control diffs cleaner.\n",
    "- **Parentheses:** Adds or removes parentheses where it deems necessary for clarity or style.\n",
    "- **Whitespace:** Standardizes whitespace around operators, after commas, and in other contexts.\n",
    "- **Imports:** Sorts import statements according to PEP 8 (standard library, third-party, local) and groups them.\n",
    "- **Function Definitions and Calls:** Enforces consistent spacing and line breaks in function signatures and calls.\n",
    "- **Conditional Statements:** Applies consistent formatting to `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks.\n",
    "- **Data Structures:** Formats lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries for better readability, often placing each element on a new line if they are long or multi-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black Syntax and Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install black\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Basic Usage:**\n",
    "    To format a single Python file (`your_module.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    black your_module.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Black will reformat the file in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To format an entire directory (`your_project/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    black your_project/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Black will recursively format all `.py` files in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Checking for Formatting Differences (Without Modifying):**\n",
    "    Use the `--check` flag to see if a file or directory needs formatting without applying the changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    black --check your_module.py\n",
    "    black --check your_project/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Black will exit with a non-zero status code if any files need reformatting. This is useful for pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Diff Output:**\n",
    "    Use the `--diff` flag to see the changes Black would make:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    black --diff your_module.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will output a unified diff showing the before and after formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Configuration (Limited):**\n",
    "    Black's configuration is intentionally minimal. The main configuration options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--line-length <int>`:** Specify a different line length (default is 88).\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      black --line-length 120 your_module.py\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--target-version <PythonVersion>`:** Target a specific Python version for formatting (e.g., `py36`, `py37`, `py38`, `py39`, `py310`). This can influence some formatting decisions related to newer syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      black --target-version py37 your_module.py\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--include <regex>`:** A regular expression that filters in files or directories that should be formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      black --include '.*\\.py$' my_project/\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--exclude <regex>`:** A regular expression that filters out files or directories that should not be formatted. Black will ignore files matching these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      black --exclude 'tests/|docs/' my_project/\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--extend-exclude <regex>`:** Like `--exclude`, but adds to the default exclusion patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--force-exclude <regex>`:** Like `--exclude`, but takes precedence over `--include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--fast`:** Skip string normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--safe`:** Only make changes that preserve the abstract syntax tree. This is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--quiet`:** Don't emit non-error messages to stderr.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`--verbose`:** Show more verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Configuration can also be placed in a `pyproject.toml` file in your project's root directory under the `[tool.black]` section:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```toml\n",
    "    [tool.black]\n",
    "    line-length = 100\n",
    "    target-version = ['py38']\n",
    "    exclude = 'tests/,docs/'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Integration with Editors and IDEs:**\n",
    "    Most modern Python editors and IDEs have excellent support for Black, allowing you to automatically format your code on save or through a specific command. This provides seamless integration into your development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Integration with Other Tools:**\n",
    "    Black is often used in conjunction with linters like Pycodestyle and Pylint. You would typically run Black first to automatically fix formatting issues, and then run the linters to catch other style violations and potential code quality problems that Black doesn't address. Tools like Flake8 can also be configured to work well with Black.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Using Black:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Formatting:** Saves significant time and effort by automating code formatting.\n",
    "- **Enforces Consistency:** Ensures a uniform code style across your project and team.\n",
    "- **Eliminates Style Debates:** Removes subjective discussions about formatting preferences.\n",
    "- **Improved Readability:** Leads to more visually consistent and easier-to-read code.\n",
    "- **Idempotent:** Running it multiple times yields the same result.\n",
    "- **Easy Integration:** Integrates well with editors, IDEs, pre-commit hooks, and CI/CD pipelines.\n",
    "- **Focus on Code:** Allows developers to concentrate on the logic of their code rather than formatting details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Black:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opinionated Nature:** Its lack of extensive configuration can be a drawback for projects with strong pre-existing style preferences that differ from Black's.\n",
    "- **Limited Scope:** Black only handles formatting and doesn't catch logical errors or other code quality issues. You still need linters for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Black is a powerful and highly recommended tool for automatically formatting Python code. Its uncompromising nature promotes consistency and eliminates style debates, allowing developers to focus on writing better code. By integrating Black into your development workflow, you can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your Python projects. It's best used in conjunction with linters like Pycodestyle and Pylint for comprehensive code quality assurance.\n"

    "## **4. Black’s Formatting Rules (Theory)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Black enforces strict rules to ensure **consistent** and **readable** code. Here’s what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Indentation & Line Length**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **4 spaces** per indentation level (PEP 8 compliant).\n",
    "- **Line length = 88 characters** (slightly more than PEP 8’s 79).\n",
    "  - If a line exceeds this, Black **reflows** it (e.g., breaking long function calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Quotes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prefers double quotes (`\"`) for strings**, but keeps existing quotes if they match.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Alice\"  # Black prefers this\n",
    "  name = 'Alice'  # Kept if already single quotes\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Trailing Commas**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adds trailing commas in **multiline collections** for cleaner diffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Before\n",
    "  fruits = [\n",
    "      \"apple\",\n",
    "      \"banana\"\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "\n",
    "  # After Black\n",
    "  fruits = [\n",
    "      \"apple\",\n",
    "      \"banana\",\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **D. Spacing Around Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures **consistent spacing** around operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Before\n",
    "  x=1+2*3\n",
    "\n",
    "  # After Black\n",
    "  x = 1 + 2 * 3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **E. Function & Class Definitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One blank line** around top-level functions/classes.\n",
    "- **Two blank lines** before top-level functions in a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def foo():\n",
    "      pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  def bar():\n",
    "      pass\n",
    "  ```\n",
