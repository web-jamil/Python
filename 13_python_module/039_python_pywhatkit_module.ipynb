    "### 3. **Core Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of the major functionalities of the `pywhatkit` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Sending WhatsApp Messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular features of `pywhatkit` is the ability to send WhatsApp messages automatically. The function `sendwhatmsg` allows you to send a message to a specific phone number at a scheduled time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Sending a WhatsApp message\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Send a WhatsApp message to a specific number at 10:30 AM\n",
    "kit.sendwhatmsg(\"+1234567890\", \"Hello from Python!\", 10, 30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `phone_num`: The phone number to which the message will be sent (must include the country code, e.g., `+1` for the USA).\n",
    "  - `message`: The text message you want to send.\n",
    "  - `time_hour`: The hour at which the message should be sent.\n",
    "  - `time_minute`: The minute at which the message should be sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function opens WhatsApp Web in the browser at the specified time and sends the message automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Performing a Google Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `pywhatkit` to perform Google searches directly from Python using the `search` function. It opens the web browser and performs the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Performing a Google search\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform a Google search for 'Python tutorials'\n",
    "kit.search(\"Python tutorials\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `query`: The search query you want to perform (e.g., \"Python tutorials\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open the default web browser and perform the search on Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Playing YouTube Videos**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pywhatkit` can open and play YouTube videos directly by providing a URL or a video title. The `playonyt` function is used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Playing a YouTube video\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Play a YouTube video by search query\n",
    "kit.playonyt(\"Despacito\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `query`: The search query or video title to be played.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will automatically open YouTube in the default web browser and play the first video found based on the search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Text to Handwriting**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pywhatkit` can convert a given text into a handwriting-like font and save it as an image. This is a fun feature that simulates a handwritten note from a string of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Convert text to handwriting\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert a string of text into a handwriting image\n",
    "kit.text_to_handwriting(\"Hello, this is a test message!\", save_to=\"output.png\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `text`: The text to convert into handwriting.\n",
    "  - `save_to`: The filename to save the output image (optional, defaults to `handwriting.png`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function saves the generated handwriting image as a PNG file. The text will be written in a handwriting-like font.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. ASCII Art Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert an image to ASCII art using the `image_to_ascii_art` function. This can be useful for creating text-based representations of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Convert an image to ASCII art\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert an image to ASCII art and save it as a text file\n",

    "  - `output_file`: Name of the text file to save the ASCII art.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function converts the image at the specified path into ASCII art and writes it to a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Drawing with Turtle Graphics**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pywhatkit` provides a function `draw_turtle()` to draw a simple pattern using Python’s turtle graphics library.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Drawing with Turtle graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Draw a simple pattern using turtle graphics\n",
    "kit.draw_turtle()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function opens the turtle graphics window and draws a simple design using Python's built-in turtle module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Information Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pywhatkit` has some functions to retrieve basic information, such as the current IP address of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Getting IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve the current system's IP address\n",
    "ip = kit.get_ip()\n",
    "print(f\"Your IP address is: {ip}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Other Utility Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shutdown the computer**: You can use the `shutdown()` function to shut down the computer after a specified time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Shutdown computer\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shutdown the computer after 5 seconds\n",
    "kit.shutdown(time=5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set an alarm**: You can set an alarm to alert you at a specific time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Setting an alarm\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pywhatkit as kit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set an alarm to ring at 8:30 AM\n",
    "kit.set_alarm(8, 30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Additional Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Google Search via Voice**: The library also supports performing a Google search via voice. This is part of the `pywhatkit` voice functionalities, but it may need additional setup like installing `speech_recognition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated Text Messages**: Beyond WhatsApp, the library has the potential to integrate with other messaging platforms, though WhatsApp remains its primary feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Automation**: Automate day-to-day tasks with minimal code, like sending messages at specific times, opening websites, or playing music.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Automation**: The library automates web services, so it relies on having a browser running and being logged into services like WhatsApp Web. This means the internet connection needs to be active, and the user must be logged in to services.\n",
    "- **Security Concerns**: Sending messages automatically (e.g., through WhatsApp) could be misused if not done responsibly. Make sure to be cautious with how you use this library, particularly for automated messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependence on Other Services**: Some features require services like WhatsApp Web or Google services to be accessible, and this may vary across systems or platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pywhatkit` library is a fun and practical tool for automating simple tasks in Python. Whether you're sending WhatsApp messages, performing Google searches, or converting text to handwriting, `pywhatkit` simplifies the interaction with various services. It’s particularly useful for basic automation and for developers who want to implement simple, fun projects or scripts for day-to-day tasks.\n"
