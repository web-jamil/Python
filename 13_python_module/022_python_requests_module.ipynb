    "### **Python `requests` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requests` module is one of the most popular libraries in Python for making HTTP requests. It abstracts the complexities of making requests and interacting with web servers, providing a simple and human-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests to web services and receiving responses. With `requests`, you can interact with REST APIs, download data, submit forms, handle JSON data, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of the `requests` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HTTP Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `requests` module provides methods that correspond to various HTTP operations, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more. These methods are the foundation of communication between a client (Python script) and a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **GET**: Used to retrieve data from the server.\n",
    "   - **POST**: Used to send data to the server (e.g., form submissions or API requests).\n",
    "   - **PUT**: Used to update data on the server.\n",
    "   - **DELETE**: Used to delete data from the server.\n",
    "   - **HEAD**: Similar to `GET`, but does not return the body of the response, only the headers.\n",
    "   - **OPTIONS**: Used to get information about the communication options available for the target resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Request and Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A **request** consists of a URL, optional headers, parameters, and data sent to the server.\n",
    "   - A **response** is the server's reply, which typically includes a status code (indicating success or failure), headers, and data (such as JSON, HTML, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The URL is the web address to which you send the request. It contains a domain, path, and can also include query parameters for specific data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Status Codes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - HTTP status codes are returned in the server's response to indicate the outcome of the request:\n",
    "     - **200**: OK – The request was successful.\n",
    "     - **404**: Not Found – The resource could not be found on the server.\n",
    "     - **500**: Internal Server Error – The server encountered an error while processing the request.\n",
    "     - **301**: Moved Permanently – The resource has been moved to a new URL.\n",
    "     - **401**: Unauthorized – Authentication is required.\n",
    "     - **403**: Forbidden – You do not have permission to access the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Session Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `requests` module provides the `Session` object, which maintains persistent connections and session-level settings across multiple requests. It helps with handling cookies, headers, and other session-based attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Headers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - HTTP headers are metadata sent along with the request or response to convey information, such as content type, authentication, etc. You can pass custom headers in a request to influence how the server responds.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Parameters (query parameters) are used in the URL to send additional information to the server. They are often used in `GET` requests to filter, sort, or paginate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the `requests` module, you can use `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to demonstrate how to use the `requests` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Sending a GET Request:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `GET` method is used to retrieve data from a specified resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')\n",
    "print(response.status_code)  # Prints the HTTP status code\n",
    "print(response.text)         # Prints the response content as text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `response.status_code`: Returns the HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404).\n",
    "- `response.text`: Returns the body of the response as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Sending a POST Request:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `POST` method is used to send data to the server, often used for submitting form data or creating resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {'title': 'foo', 'body': 'bar', 'userId': 1}\n",
    "response = requests.post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', data=data)\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "print(response.json())  # The server returns JSON data, so we use .json() to parse it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `response.json()`: Automatically parses the JSON response into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Sending a PUT Request:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `PUT` method is used to update data on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {'title': 'foo', 'body': 'bar', 'userId': 1}\n",
    "response = requests.put('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', data=data)\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "print(response.json())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Sending a DELETE Request:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `DELETE` method is used to remove data from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.delete('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Working with Query Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass query parameters to a URL using the `params` argument. Query parameters are often used in `GET` requests to filter or refine the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "params = {'userId': 1}\n",
    "response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', params=params)\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "print(response.json())  # Parse the response as JSON\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Working with Headers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom headers can be passed in the request using the `headers` argument. For example, you might need to pass authentication tokens or specify the content type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer your_token_here'}\n",
    "response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers=headers)\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "print(response.json())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Timeouts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests can sometimes take too long to respond. To avoid waiting indefinitely, you can set a timeout for your request. If the request takes longer than the timeout, a `Timeout` exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', timeout=5)\n",
    "    print(response.status_code)\n",
    "except requests.Timeout:\n",
    "    print(\"The request timed out.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can handle common errors such as connection errors, timeouts, or invalid HTTP responses using `try-except` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')\n",
    "    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n",
    "    print(response.status_code)\n",
    "except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:\n",
    "    print(f\"HTTP error occurred: {errh}\")\n",
    "except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error connecting: {errc}\")\n",
    "except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:\n",
    "    print(f\"Timeout error occurred: {errt}\")\n",
    "except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {err}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Session Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`requests.Session` allows you to persist certain parameters across requests, such as headers, cookies, and authentication. This is useful for maintaining a login session or handling multiple related requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "session = requests.Session()\n",
    "session.headers.update({'User-Agent': 'my-app'})\n",
    "\n",
    "response = session.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another request using the same session\n",
    "response2 = session.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments')\n",
    "print(response2.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling JSON Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs return data in JSON format. You can easily parse this JSON response into a Python dictionary using the `json()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')\n",
    "data = response.json()  # Parse the response as JSON\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Uploading Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requests` module allows you to send files as part of a request, such as uploading a file to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "files = {'file': open('example.txt', 'rb')}\n",
    "response = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', files=files)\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "print(response.json())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Authentication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You can authenticate a request using HTTP Basic Authentication by providing the username and password in the `auth` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\n",
    "\n",
    "   response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass'))\n",
    "   print(response.status_code)\n",
    "   print(response.json())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Cookies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `requests` module automatically handles cookies. You can also manually pass cookies in a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   cookies = {'session_id': 'abc123'}\n",
    "   response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies=cookies)\n",
    "   print(response.json())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Redirects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - By default, `requests` follows redirects (HTTP 3xx responses). You can disable this behavior if needed by setting `allow_redirects=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = requests.get('http://example.com', allow_redirects=False)\n",
    "   print(response.status_code)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requests` module is a powerful and simple tool for sending HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexity of working with HTTP and offers an easy-to-use API to interact with web services, APIs, and websites. Whether you are making GET or POST requests, uploading files, handling sessions, or managing authentication, `requests` provides all the tools you need to build web-based Python applications efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "With its rich features, including support for\n",
    "\n",
    "headers, query parameters, cookies, authentication, and more, `requests` is the go-to library for working with HTTP in Python.\n"
