    "The `opencv-python` library is a Python wrapper around the **OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) framework, which is one of the most popular and comprehensive open-source computer vision libraries used for real-time image processing, video capture, and computer vision tasks. OpenCV provides a set of powerful tools for image and video analysis, feature extraction, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenCV in Python, you need to install the `opencv-python` package. You can install it using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install opencv-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional features (such as non-free algorithms like SIFT and SURF), you can install `opencv-contrib-python`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install opencv-contrib-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Core Concepts of OpenCV**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Image Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCV, images are represented as **matrices (NumPy arrays)**. Each image has multiple channels (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue channels for a color image), and each channel contains intensity values for each pixel in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grayscale Image**: An image that consists of shades of gray. It has only one channel.\n",
    "- **Color Image**: An image that uses three channels (RGB or BGR) to represent colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Basic Image Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV supports several types of images:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8-bit unsigned integer (uint8)**: This is the most common image type where each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255.\n",
    "- **16-bit signed integer (int16)**: Less commonly used but available in OpenCV.\n",
    "- **32-bit floating point (float32)**: Used when you need more precision, often used in advanced processing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Matrices (Images) in OpenCV**\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are represented as multi-dimensional arrays (NumPy arrays). For example, an image with a size of `height x width x channels` is a 3D matrix, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Height is the number of rows (pixels in vertical direction),\n",
    "- Width is the number of columns (pixels in horizontal direction),\n",
    "- Channels are the color channels (for a color image, there are typically 3 channels: Red, Green, Blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Key Functions and Usage in OpenCV**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Image I/O Functions**\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Example: Drawing a Rectangle and Text\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Draw a rectangle (top-left corner, bottom-right corner, color, thickness)\n",
    "cv2.rectangle(image, (50, 50), (200, 200), (0, 255, 0), 3)\n",
    "\n",
