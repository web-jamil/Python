    "The `python-vlc` module is a Python binding for the VLC media player. VLC (VideoLAN Client) is a popular open-source multimedia player that supports a variety of audio and video formats. The `python-vlc` module allows you to control VLC directly from Python scripts, making it a powerful tool for media playback, streaming, and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a deep dive into the concepts, theory, and all relevant aspects of the `python-vlc` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `python-vlc` module, you need to install both VLC media player and the Python bindings for VLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install VLC:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download and install the VLC player from [VLC Official Website](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install `python-vlc`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can install the `python-vlc` module via `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install python-vlc\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can use the `vlc` module to interact with VLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Basic Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VLC Media Player:**\n",
    "\n",
    "VLC is a versatile multimedia player and framework that can play a variety of multimedia file formats, such as MP3, MP4, AVI, and much more. It also supports streaming over the network (HTTP, RTSP, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **python-vlc Binding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module provides an interface to interact with the VLC media player programmatically. It wraps VLC’s core features, such as media playback, media control, playlist management, and streaming, in Python functions and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Core Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VLC MediaPlayer Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MediaPlayer` class is the heart of the `python-vlc` module. It allows you to control media playback, including loading, playing, pausing, and stopping media.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import vlc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a VLC instance\n",
    "player = vlc.MediaPlayer()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load media\n",
    "media = vlc.Media(\"your_media_file.mp4\")\n",
    "player.set_media(media)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Play media\n",
    "player.play()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pause media\n",
    "player.pause()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stop media\n",
    "player.stop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VLC Media Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Media` class represents the media file or stream that you want to play. You can create a `Media` object by specifying a path to the media file or a URL for streaming media.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "media = vlc.Media(\"file:///path/to/your/media.mp4\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VLC MediaList and MediaListPlayer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MediaList` class allows you to manage multiple media items (like a playlist). The `MediaListPlayer` class controls a list of media items and allows you to play them sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "media_list = vlc.MediaList()\n",
    "media_list.add_media(vlc.Media(\"file:///path/to/first_media.mp4\"))\n",
    "media_list.add_media(vlc.Media(\"file:///path/to/second_media.mp4\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "list_player = vlc.MediaListPlayer()\n",
    "list_player.set_media_player(player)\n",
    "list_player.set_media_list(media_list)\n",
    "list_player.play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VLC Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module supports event handling, which allows you to react to various media playback events (e.g., playback end, media changed). You can subscribe to events like `MediaPlayerEndReached`, `MediaPlayerPlaying`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def event_handler(event):\n",
    "    if event.type == vlc.EventType.MediaPlayerEndReached:\n",
    "        print(\"Media playback has ended.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "player.event_manager().event_attach(vlc.EventType.MediaPlayerEndReached, event_handler)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Common Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Playing Media**\n",
    "\n",
    "To play media from a file or stream, create a `MediaPlayer` instance, load a `Media` object, and call the `play()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player = vlc.MediaPlayer()\n",
    "media = vlc.Media(\"file:///path/to/your/video.mp4\")\n",
    "player.set_media(media)\n",
    "player.play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Controlling Playback**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control playback using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `play()`: Starts playback.\n",
    "- `pause()`: Pauses playback.\n",
    "- `stop()`: Stops playback.\n",
    "- `set_time(ms)`: Seeks to a specific time in milliseconds.\n",
    "- `get_time()`: Returns the current playback time in milliseconds.\n",
    "- `set_rate(rate)`: Sets the playback speed, where 1.0 is normal speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player.set_time(30000)  # Seek to 30 seconds\n",
    "player.set_rate(1.5)    # Play at 1.5x speed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Volume Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can adjust the volume using the `set_volume()` and `get_volume()` methods. Volume is specified as an integer between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player.set_volume(50)  # Set volume to 50%\n",
    "current_volume = player.get_volume()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Fullscreen and Video Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control video output in a window or fullscreen mode using the `set_fullscreen()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player.set_fullscreen(True)  # Set the video to fullscreen\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set the video output window by using `set_hwnd()` (on Windows) or `set_xwindow()` (on Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Advanced Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Streaming Media**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module supports streaming from a variety of protocols like HTTP, RTSP, RTMP, and others. To stream media, simply provide a URL to the `Media` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "media = vlc.Media(\"http://path/to/stream\")\n",
    "player.set_media(media)\n",
    "player.play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Audio and Video Track Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "VLC allows you to switch between different audio and video tracks if available. You can use the `set_audio_track()` and `set_video_track()` methods to change tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player.set_audio_track(1)  # Select the second audio track\n",
    "player.set_video_track(0)  # Select the first video track\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Subtitles**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also manage subtitles, such as enabling or disabling them, or selecting a subtitle track.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "player.set_subtitle_file(\"path_to_subtitle_file.srt\")\n",
    "player.set_subtitle_track(0)  # Select the first subtitle track\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Event Handling and Callbacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module allows you to attach custom event handlers to react to events like playback completion, errors, or media state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def media_player_event_handler(event):\n",
    "    if event.type == vlc.EventType.MediaPlayerEndReached:\n",
    "        print(\"Playback finished.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "player.event_manager().event_attach(vlc.EventType.MediaPlayerEndReached, media_player_event_handler)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **VLC Instance Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a custom VLC instance that allows you to customize the settings (such as enabling or disabling specific VLC modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "instance = vlc.Instance(\"--no-xlib\")\n",
    "player = instance.media_player_new()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Error Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module provides error codes that you can use to check the status of media loading or playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if player.get_state() == vlc.State.Error:\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Cross-Platform Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module is cross-platform, but certain methods might be specific to the underlying operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On Windows, you typically use `set_hwnd()` to set the video window.\n",
    "- On Linux, you may use `set_xwindow()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-vlc` module provides a robust interface for controlling VLC media player from Python. It can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Play local media files or stream content.\n",
    "- Control playback (pause, resume, stop, seek, etc.).\n",
    "- Handle events and react to playback states.\n",
    "- Manage media playlists, tracks, subtitles, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes `python-vlc` an excellent tool for building media applications, automation, and interactive media experiences using VLC.\n"
