    "### **Python `re` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re` module in Python is the library used for working with regular expressions (regex). Regular expressions are patterns used to match sequences of characters in strings. The `re` module allows you to search for specific patterns, replace text, or split strings based on matching patterns, among other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `re` provides a powerful and flexible way to perform complex text processing and pattern matching tasks with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of the `re` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regular Expressions (Regex):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that form a search pattern. It is mainly used for string matching and manipulation.\n",
    "   - Regex syntax includes a variety of metacharacters, special sequences, and character classes that allow for sophisticated string searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `re` module uses patterns (regex patterns) to match parts of strings. These patterns allow for the identification of specific sequences of characters, such as dates, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metacharacters and Special Symbols:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The key to using regular expressions is understanding the metacharacters and special symbols that make up the patterns. Some common metacharacters are:\n",
    "     - `.`: Matches any character except newline.\n",
    "     - `^`: Matches the start of the string.\n",
    "     - `$`: Matches the end of the string.\n",
    "     - `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding character.\n",
    "     - `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding character.\n",
    "     - `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character.\n",
    "     - `[]`: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.\n",
    "     - `|`: Acts like an OR operator, matches either the left or the right part.\n",
    "     - `()` : Groups part of the regex into a subpattern for extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flags:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Flags are optional parameters that modify the behavior of the pattern matching. Common flags include:\n",
    "     - `re.IGNORECASE` or `re.I`: Makes the pattern case-insensitive.\n",
    "     - `re.MULTILINE` or `re.M`: Makes `^` and `$` match the start and end of each line, not just the start and end of the string.\n",
    "     - `re.DOTALL` or `re.S`: Makes `.` match any character, including newline.\n",
    "     - `re.VERBOSE` or `re.X`: Allows you to write more readable regex patterns with comments and spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Matching Functions:**\n",
    "   - The `re` module provides several functions to work with patterns:\n",
    "     - `re.match()`: Checks if the regex matches the beginning of the string.\n",
    "     - `re.search()`: Searches the string for the first occurrence of the pattern.\n",
    "     - `re.findall()`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list.\n",
    "     - `re.finditer()`: Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all matches.\n",
    "     - `re.sub()`: Substitutes parts of the string that match the pattern with a new string.\n",
    "     - `re.split()`: Splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Usage of the `re` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some fundamental concepts and examples of how to use the `re` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Importing the `re` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Using `re.match()` for Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `re.match()` function checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'hello'\n",
    "text = 'hello world'\n",
    "match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: hello\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No match found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Using `re.search()` for Searching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `re.search()` function searches the entire string for the first occurrence of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'world'\n",
    "text = 'hello world'\n",
    "search = re.search(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "if search:\n",
    "    print(\"Search found:\", search.group())  # Output: Search found: world\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No match found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Using `re.findall()` to Find All Matches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `re.findall()` function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'\\d+'  # Match one or more digits\n",
    "text = 'The year is 2023, and the month is 03.'\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Matches found:\", matches)  # Output: Matches found: ['2023', '03']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Using `re.sub()` for Substitution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `re.sub()` function replaces all occurrences of the pattern with a new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'\\d+'  # Match digits\n",
    "text = 'The year is 2023, and the month is 03.'\n",
    "new_text = re.sub(pattern, 'XX', text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Replaced text:\", new_text)  # Output: Replaced text: The year is XX, and the month is XX.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Using `re.split()` to Split Strings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `re.split()` function splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'\\s+'  # Match one or more whitespace characters\n",
    "text = 'The quick brown fox'\n",
    "split_text = re.split(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Split text:\", split_text)  # Output: Split text: ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metacharacters and Special Symbols in Regex:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dot (`.`):**\n",
    "   - Matches any character except a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'a.b'  # Matches 'a' followed by any character followed by 'b'\n",
    "text = 'aab'\n",
    "match = re.search(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: aab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Caret (`^`) and Dollar (`$`):**\n",
    "   - `^` matches the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - `$` matches the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'^hello'\n",
    "text = 'hello world'\n",
    "match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Asterisk (`*`):**\n",
    "   - Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'a*b'  # Matches 'b', 'ab', 'aab', etc.\n",
    "text = 'aaab'\n",
    "match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",

    "text = 'aaab'\n",
    "match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: aaab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Question Mark (`?`):**\n",
    "   - Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'colou?r'  # Matches both 'color' and 'colour'\n",
    "text = 'color'\n",
    "match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: color\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Square Brackets (`[]`):**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character from the set or range inside the brackets.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "print(\"Matches found:\", matches)  # Output: Matches found: ['a', 'e']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Pipe (`|`):**\n",
    "   - Acts like an OR operator. Matches the pattern before or after the pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'cat|dog'  # Matches either 'cat' or 'dog'\n",
    "text = 'I have a dog.'\n",

    "\n",
    "print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: ababab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lookahead and Lookbehind Assertions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Lookahead (`?=`, `?!`) and Lookbehind (`?<=`, `?<!`) are assertions that match a pattern only if it's followed or preceded by another pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Positive Lookahead (`?=`)**: Matches a pattern only if it is followed by another pattern.\n",
    "   - **Negative Lookahead (`?!`)**: Matches a pattern only if it is not followed by another pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   pattern = r'\\d+(?=\\s)'  # Matches digits only if followed by a space\n",
    "   text = '123 456'\n",
    "   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Matches found:\", matches)  # Output: Matches found: ['123']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Named Groups:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You can give names to groups in the regular expression to make the results more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   pattern = r'(?P<area_code>\\d{3})-(?P<exchange>\\d{3})-(?P<number>\\d{4})'\n",
    "   text = '415-555-1234'\n",
    "   match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "   if match:\n",
    "       print(match.group('area_code'))  # Output: 415\n",
    "       print(match.group('exchange'))  # Output: 555\n",
    "       print(match.group('number'))  # Output: 1234\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \\*\\*Non\n",
    "\n",
    "-capturing Groups:\\*\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "- A non-capturing group allows grouping of regex elements without storing the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r'(?:ab)+'\n",
    "text = 'ababab'\n",
    "match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Match found:\", match.group())  # Output: Match found: ababab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular expressions are powerful but can be computationally expensive, especially with complex patterns or large text data.\n",
    "- For large datasets or performance-critical applications, use regex sparingly and consider optimizing patterns for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re` module is an essential tool for pattern matching, searching, replacing, and splitting strings in Python. With a rich set of features including metacharacters, flags, and advanced regex techniques like lookaheads, lookbehinds, and named groups, the `re` module provides robust functionality for text processing tasks. Understanding and mastering regular expressions can greatly improve your ability to handle complex string manipulations and pattern searches in Python.\n"
