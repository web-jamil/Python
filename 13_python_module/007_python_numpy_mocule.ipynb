    "\n",
    "### **What is NumPy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library used for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions. The central object in NumPy is the **array**, which is a grid of values (all of the same type) indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts in NumPy Arrays**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array Object**:\n",
    "   - The main object in NumPy is `ndarray`, which is a multi-dimensional array object. It is an efficient and flexible data structure.\n",
    "2. **Homogeneous Data Type**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays contain elements of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dimensions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **1D Array**: A simple array like a list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).\n",
    "   - **2D Array**: A matrix (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`).\n",
    "   - **3D Array**: A three-dimensional array (e.g., a stack of matrices).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shape and Size**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The **shape** of an array represents the number of elements along each axis (dimension). For example, a 2D array of size 3x4 would have a shape `(3, 4)`.\n",
    "   - The **size** of the array represents the total number of elements in the array (e.g., size of shape `(3, 4)` would be 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Indexing**:\n",
    "   - NumPy arrays can be indexed in a similar way to Python lists, but with the added benefit of supporting multiple dimensions.\n",

    "**Indexing** and **slicing** are essential for accessing and manipulating data within NumPy arrays. Understanding these concepts enables you to work efficiently with **1D**, **2D**, and **3D arrays**, and even higher-dimensional arrays. From basic indexing to advanced slicing, Boolean indexing, and fancy indexing, NumPy provides powerful tools to interact with data in\n",
