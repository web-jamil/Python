    "### **Python `pytest` Module: All Concepts and Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` is a powerful and widely used testing framework in Python. It is used for writing simple as well as scalable test cases. It makes testing Python code easy by providing simple syntax, powerful features, and easy-to-use plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a detailed guide to `pytest`, covering its core concepts, syntax, and how to effectively use it for testing Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction to `pytest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` is a testing framework for Python that allows you to write test cases, run tests, and report results. It supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple test functions**.\n",
    "- **Advanced features** like fixtures, parameterized tests, and plugins.\n",
    "- **Test discovery**.\n",
    "- **Easy assertions**.\n",
    "- **Detailed error reporting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `pytest`, you need to install it using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Writing Basic Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `pytest` test function is simply a function prefixed with the keyword `test_`. These functions should contain the logic that tests a particular unit of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of a simple test:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_addition():\n",
    "    assert 1 + 1 == 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Case Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "A test case in `pytest` typically contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup**: Setting up the environment or test data.\n",
    "- **Execution**: Calling the function or method under test.\n",
    "- **Assertion**: Checking whether the output is as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_subtraction():\n",
    "    result = 10 - 5\n",
    "    assert result == 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Running Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, simply use the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` will automatically discover and run all the test functions (i.e., functions that start with `test_`) in the current directory and subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Running a specific test function**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a specific test, use the `-k` option followed by the name of the test function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest -k test_addition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Assertions in `pytest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` makes assertions simple and readable. The `assert` statement is used to verify that an expression evaluates to `True`. If the expression is `False`, `pytest` will raise an `AssertionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_multiplication():\n",
    "    result = 2 * 3\n",
    "    assert result == 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Useful Assertion Functions in `pytest`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `assert a == b`: Check if `a` is equal to `b`.\n",
    "- `assert a != b`: Check if `a` is not equal to `b`.\n",
    "- `assert a > b`: Check if `a` is greater than `b`.\n",
    "- `assert a < b`: Check if `a` is less than `b`.\n",
    "- `assert a in b`: Check if `a` is in `b`.\n",
    "- `assert a not in b`: Check if `a` is not in `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Detailed Failure Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an assertion fails, `pytest` provides a detailed output that helps to understand what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_division():\n",
    "    assert 10 / 2 == 5  # Passes\n",
    "    assert 10 / 2 == 3  # Fails and provides details\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Test Discovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` automatically discovers all the test cases in your project. By default, it looks for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files that start with `test_` or end with `_test.py`.\n",
    "- Functions that start with `test_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to specify a particular directory or file to test, you can pass the file or directory name to the `pytest` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest tests/test_file.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Test Fixtures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixtures are used to set up preconditions for your tests. They provide a way to reuse common setup code across tests, such as initializing database connections, preparing test data, or creating mock objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating Fixtures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixtures are created using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.fixture\n",
    "def sample_data():\n",
    "    return {'key': 'value'}\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_with_fixture(sample_data):\n",
    "    assert sample_data['key'] == 'value'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Fixtures in Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a fixture is defined, it can be passed as a parameter to any test function. `pytest` automatically looks for a fixture that matches the parameter name and provides it to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Fixture Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a fixture has a **function scope**, which means the fixture will be created and destroyed for each test function. You can change the scope of a fixture using the `scope` parameter in the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'function'`: Default. The fixture is created and destroyed for each test function.\n",
    "- `'class'`: The fixture is created once per class and shared by all test methods.\n",
    "- `'module'`: The fixture is created once per module.\n",
    "- `'session'`: The fixture is created once per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pytest.fixture(scope='module')\n",
    "def setup_module():\n",
    "    # Setup code\n",
    "    return \"Setup complete\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Parametrized Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "With `pytest.mark.parametrize`, you can easily run a test with multiple sets of input values, enabling you to test a function with different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using `pytest.mark.parametrize`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"input, expected\", [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)])\n",
    "def test_multiplication(input, expected):\n",
    "    assert input * 2 == expected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This test will run three times with different sets of `input` and `expected` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Test Markers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Markers in `pytest` are used to add metadata to tests, like grouping tests, skipping tests, or marking them as expected failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Markers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`@pytest.mark.skip`**: Skip a test.\n",
    "- **`@pytest.mark.skipif(condition)`**: Skip a test based on a condition.\n",
    "- **`@pytest.mark.xfail`**: Mark a test as expected to fail.\n",
    "- **`@pytest.mark.parametrize`**: Parameterize a test function with multiple sets of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Skipping a test**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pytest.mark.skip(reason=\"Skipping this test\")\n",
    "def test_foo():\n",
    "    assert 1 == 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Expected Failure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pytest.mark.xfail\n",
    "def test_expected_fail():\n",
    "    assert 1 + 1 == 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Test Output and Reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` provides rich output by default, showing the status of each test and the reason for any failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Verbose Mode**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more detailed information on the test results, you can use the `-v` flag (verbose mode):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Report Formats**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` supports different formats for test reports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plain Text (default)**: Simple console output.\n",
    "- **JUnit XML**: For CI/CD systems.\n",
    "- **HTML Report**: Using `pytest-html` plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate an HTML report, you can install the `pytest-html` plugin and use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest-html\n",
    "pytest --html=report.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Running Tests in Parallel**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run tests in parallel using the `pytest-xdist` plugin. This can speed up test execution by running tests concurrently on multiple CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest-xdist\n",
    "pytest -n 4  # Run tests on 4 CPU cores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. Handling Test Failures and Debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a test fails, `pytest` provides detailed failure messages. You can use the `--pdb` option to start the Python debugger (`pdb`) when a test fails, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --pdb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13. Organizing Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can organize tests by placing them into directories and using test discovery. It's common to create a `tests` folder to hold all your test files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "project/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── my_module.py\n",
    "└── tests/\n",
    "    ├── __init__.py\n",
    "    ├── test_module.py\n",
    "    └── test_functions.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run tests from the root directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest tests/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **14. Advanced Features of `pytest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pytest` Plugins**: There are numerous plugins available to extend `pytest`'s functionality, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `pytest-cov` (for test coverage reporting).\n",
    "  - `pytest-mock` (for mocking functionality).\n",
    "  - `pytest-django` (for testing Django applications).\n",
    "  - `pytest-flask` (for testing Flask applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Hooks**: `pytest` provides hooks like `pytest_runtest_protocol()` that allow you to hook into different points during test execution and customize behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Assertions Rewriting**: `pytest` automatically rewrites assertion statements to provide more helpful failure messages without requiring you to use any special methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` is a powerful and flexible testing framework for Python. Some of its key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple syntax**: Write tests quickly and concisely.\n",
    "- **Rich features**: Fixtures, parametrized tests, and markers allow complex testing scenarios.\n",
    "- **Test discovery and organization**: Automatically discovers and runs tests.\n",
