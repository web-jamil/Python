    "### **Python `cmath` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cmath` module in Python is part of the standard library and is specifically designed for working with complex numbers. It provides a range of mathematical functions for handling complex numbers, including functions for trigonometry, logarithms, and other complex number operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the `math` module, which only supports real numbers, the `cmath` module supports complex numbers and extends the functionality of mathematical operations to handle complex results.\n",

    "### **Key Concepts of the `cmath` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Numbers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A **complex number** is a number that has both a real part and an imaginary part. It is represented as `a + bj`, where:\n",
    "     - `a` is the real part of the complex number.\n",
    "     - `b` is the imaginary part of the complex number.\n",
    "     - `j` or `i` represents the imaginary unit (i.e., `i^2 = -1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complex Arithmetic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Complex numbers support standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `cmath` module provides functions for performing these operations and for converting between polar and rectangular forms of complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polar Coordinates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Complex numbers can be represented in **polar form**, where a complex number `z = a + bj` is written as `r(cos θ + j sin θ)` or `r * e^(jθ)`, where:\n",
    "     - `r` is the magnitude (absolute value) of the complex number.\n",
    "     - `θ` is the phase (angle), also known as the argument of the complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functions in `cmath`:**\n",
    "   - The `cmath` module includes various functions to calculate magnitudes, phases, trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, and other operations specifically for complex numbers.\n",
