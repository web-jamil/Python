    "The `wikipedia-api` library in Python provides a convenient way to interact with the Wikipedia API to extract and work with content from Wikipedia articles. This Python wrapper allows you to easily search for articles, extract content, and navigate through Wikipedia pages, all while avoiding the complexities of dealing with raw HTTP requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed explanation of the key concepts, functionality, and usage of the `wikipedia-api` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wikipedia-api` library can be installed via `pip`, the Python package manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install wikipedia-api\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wikipedia-api` module provides methods to access and parse data from Wikipedia. Here's an overview of the core concepts and terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Wikipedia API and Pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wikipedia**: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia with articles written in many languages. Each article can be considered a \"page.\"\n",
    "- **Page**: A page in the context of `wikipedia-api` refers to a specific Wikipedia article. You can retrieve content, sections, links, and other metadata from a page using the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Wikipedia Language Support**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wikipedia-api` module supports articles in multiple languages. You can specify which language version of Wikipedia you'd like to access by setting the language parameter (default is English).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Wikipedia API Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are primarily two types of objects used in the `wikipedia-api` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wikipedia**: The main object representing the Wikipedia API for a specific language.\n",
    "- **Page**: Represents a specific Wikipedia article (or page), allowing you to retrieve various properties like text content, sections, links, and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Core Functions and Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an overview of how to use the `wikipedia-api` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Importing the Library**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to import the `wikipediaapi` library to use its functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import wikipediaapi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Creating a Wikipedia Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "To start interacting with the Wikipedia API, you first create a `Wikipedia` object for a specific language. By default, it will be in English, but you can change this to another language by specifying the language code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Creating a Wikipedia Object\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')  # English Wikipedia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can replace `'en'` with any valid language code (e.g., `'es'` for Spanish, `'de'` for German).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Accessing a Wikipedia Page**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can retrieve a specific Wikipedia page by using the `page()` method on the `Wikipedia` object. You pass the article title (the name of the Wikipedia page) to this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Accessing a Wikipedia Page\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "page = wiki.page('Python_(programming_language)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves the page for **\"Python (programming language)\"** from English Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Checking if a Page Exists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with the page, it’s a good practice to check whether the page exists or not using the `exists()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Checking if a Page Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if page.exists():\n",
    "    print(\"Page exists!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Page does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Retrieving Page Content**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can retrieve various parts of the page, including the **summary** and the **full content**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Retrieving the Summary and Full Content\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Retrieve the summary of the page\n",
    "print(page.summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve the full text content of the page\n",
    "print(page.text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`summary`**: A short introduction or summary of the page.\n",
    "- **`text`**: The full content of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Retrieving Sections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia articles are divided into sections. You can access and list these sections through the `sections` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Listing Sections in a Page\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for section in page.sections:\n",
    "    print(section.title)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print the titles of all sections within the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Accessing Specific Sections**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access specific sections of a Wikipedia page using the section's title.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Accessing a Specific Section\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get the section on 'Syntax' from the Python programming language page\n",
    "syntax_section = page.section_by_title('Syntax')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the text of that section\n",
    "print(syntax_section.text if syntax_section else \"Section not found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Retrieving Links in a Page**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Wikipedia page contains internal links to other Wikipedia articles. You can retrieve a list of all internal links in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Retrieving Links in a Page\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for link in page.links:\n",
    "    print(link)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print all internal links found on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **9. Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia articles are typically organized into categories, which can also be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Retrieving Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for category in page.categories:\n",
    "    print(category)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print the categories the page belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Example Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s combine all the concepts into a full example that demonstrates how you can access a Wikipedia article, check its sections, and retrieve links:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Retrieving Detailed Information from a Wikipedia Page**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import wikipediaapi\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Wikipedia object for the English language\n",
    "wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve the page for \"Python (programming language)\"\n",
    "page = wiki.page('Python_(programming_language)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the page exists\n",
    "if page.exists():\n",
    "    # Print the summary of the page\n",
    "    print(\"Summary:\")\n",
    "    print(page.summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print all section titles\n",
    "    print(\"\\nSections:\")\n",
    "    for section in page.sections:\n",
    "        print(section.title)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the links within the page\n",
    "    print(\"\\nLinks:\")\n",
    "    for link in page.links:\n",
    "        print(link)\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The page does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We retrieve the page for \"Python (programming language)\".\n",
    "- We check if the page exists.\n",
    "- We print the summary, section titles, and internal links for the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Advanced Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Setting a Different Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the language of Wikipedia by passing the desired language code when initializing the `Wikipedia` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Using Wikipedia in Spanish\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wiki_spanish = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('es')  # Spanish Wikipedia\n",
    "page_spanish = wiki_spanish.page('Python_(lenguaje_de_programación)')\n",
    "print(page_spanish.summary)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Working with Disambiguation Pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Wikipedia articles might be disambiguation pages that link to multiple possible topics. You can handle these cases by retrieving the specific link that matches your desired topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Retrieving Redirected Pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Wikipedia, some pages might redirect to other pages. The `redirect` property can be used to check if the page is a redirect.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Handling Redirects\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if page.redirect:\n",
    "    print(f\"The page is a redirect to {page.redirect}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Limitations of the `wikipedia-api` Library**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited to Wikipedia Content**: The library is designed specifically for interacting with Wikipedia content, so it is not suitable for other types of content or websites.\n",
    "- **Not an Official Wikipedia API**: The `wikipedia-api` module is a Python wrapper around the Wikipedia API, but it is not officially maintained by Wikimedia. As a result, some advanced features of the API might not be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wikipedia-api` module is a simple, easy-to-use wrapper around the Wikipedia API that allows you to fetch, explore, and manipulate Wikipedia data programmatically. You can retrieve page content, access specific sections, get internal links, and more. It's especially useful for applications that require extracting information from Wikipedia or building knowledge-based tools like chatbots or knowledge extraction systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `wikipedia-api`, you can easily extract structured information from Wikipedia without having to deal with raw API requests and responses, making it a great tool for Python developers working with encyclopedic data.\n"
