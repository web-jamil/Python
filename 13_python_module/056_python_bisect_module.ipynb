    "### Python `bisect` Module: Full Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bisect` module in Python provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list repeatedly. It provides functions for efficiently inserting elements into a sorted list, finding insertion points, and performing binary searches. The module is useful in scenarios where you need to manage a sorted sequence of elements (like a priority queue or a sorted array).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bisect` module is part of the Python Standard Library, and it provides the following primary functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "2. **`bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`** or **`bisect(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "3. **`insort_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "4. **`insort_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`** or **`insort(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `bisect_left(a, x, lo, hi)` returns the index where the element `x` should be inserted into the sorted list `a` (between indices `lo` and `hi`) to maintain the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `x` already exists in the list, `bisect_left` returns the index of the **first occurrence** of `x`.\n",
    "- If `x` does not exist, it returns the index where `x` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bisect.bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `a`: The sorted list in which the insertion is being considered.\n",
    "- `x`: The element to be inserted or searched for.\n",
    "- `lo` (optional): The starting index for the search (default is `0`).\n",
    "- `hi` (optional): The ending index for the search (default is `len(a)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bisect\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "index = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)\n",
    "print(index)  # Output: 1, as 3 is found at index 1 (first occurrence)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))` or `bisect(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `bisect_right(a, x, lo, hi)` returns the index where the element `x` should be inserted to the **right** of any existing occurrences of `x` in the list `a` (between indices `lo` and `hi`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `x` exists in the list, `bisect_right` returns the index **just after the last occurrence** of `x`.\n",
    "- If `x` does not exist, it returns the index where `x` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bisect.bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))\n",
    "# or equivalently\n",

    "- `lo` (optional): The starting index for the search (default is `0`).\n",
    "- `hi` (optional): The ending index for the search (default is `len(a)`).\n",

    "x = 3\n",
    "index = bisect.bisect_right(a, x)\n",
    "print(index)  # Output: 3, as 3 is found at index 2, and the next index after 3 is 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`insort_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `insort_left(a, x, lo, hi)` inserts the element `x` into the sorted list `a` in a way that maintains the sorted order. It inserts `x` to the **left** of any existing occurrences of `x`.\n",

    "### Use Cases for `bisect`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficient Insertion into Sorted Lists:**\n",
    "   - When working with a list that needs to remain sorted (e.g., maintaining a priority queue or sorted order in an application), you can use `bisect` to find the correct position and insert elements efficiently without needing to manually sort the list.\n",
    "2. **Binary Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` functions can be used to perform binary searches in sorted arrays to quickly find the position of a target element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining Sorted Lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In applications like online ranking or streaming data where items must be inserted into a list that is kept sorted (e.g., keeping the top `n` elements in sorted order), the `insort_left` or `insort_right` functions can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Range Queries:**\n",
    "   - Using `bisect_left` and `bisect_right`, we can perform range queries on sorted data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Managing a Sorted List\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a list of numbers, and you want to keep it sorted while inserting new elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bisect\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sorted list\n",
    "nums = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert a new element while maintaining the sorted order\n",
    "bisect.insort(nums, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# After insertion, nums is sorted\n",
    "print(nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
