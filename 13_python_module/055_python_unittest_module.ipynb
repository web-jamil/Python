    "### **Python `unittest` Module: All Concepts and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `unittest` module is a built-in library in Python for writing and running tests. It follows the **xUnit** style testing framework, which is widely used in many programming languages. It is used for creating test cases, organizing tests into test suites, and running automated tests to check if the code works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of all the key concepts, functions, and features of the `unittest` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction to `unittest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `unittest` module provides a framework for creating, running, and organizing test cases in Python. It is based on the **JUnit** framework, which is a widely-used testing framework for Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test case creation**: You can define test cases that test specific parts of the code.\n",
    "- **Test suites**: You can group related tests into suites for better organization.\n",
    "- **Assertions**: It provides many assertion methods to test various conditions.\n",
    "- **Test discovery**: It can automatically discover and run tests.\n",
    "- **Test runners**: It has built-in support for running tests and generating reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Basics of Writing Tests Using `unittest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Test Case Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create tests with `unittest`, you need to create a test case class. This class should inherit from `unittest.TestCase`. Each method in this class should represent a single test case, and the method name should start with `test_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_addition(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_subtraction(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(10 - 5, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    unittest.main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Running the Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, you can use the `unittest.main()` function. This function discovers all methods in the test class that start with `test_` and runs them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python my_test_file.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run all the test methods defined in the file and output the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Assertions in `unittest`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are used to check if the output of a test matches the expected results. The `unittest` module provides various assertion methods to check conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Assertions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertEqual(a, b)`**: Checks if `a` equals `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertNotEqual(a, b)`**: Checks if `a` does not equal `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertNotEqual(2 + 2, 5)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertTrue(x)`**: Checks if `x` is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertTrue(3 > 2)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertFalse(x)`**: Checks if `x` is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertFalse(5 < 3)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertIsNone(x)`**: Checks if `x` is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertIsNone(None)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertIsNotNone(x)`**: Checks if `x` is not `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertIsNotNone(1)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertIn(a, b)`**: Checks if `a` is in `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertIn(1, [1, 2, 3])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertNotIn(a, b)`**: Checks if `a` is not in `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  self.assertNotIn(4, [1, 2, 3])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`assertRaises(exception, callable, \\*args, **kwargs)`\\*\\*: Checks if a specific exception is raised by a callable.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):\n",
    "      1 / 0\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Test Setup and Teardown: `setUp` and `tearDown`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before each test method is executed, you can use the `setUp()` method to prepare the test environment (e.g., initialize objects, open files, or set up databases). After the test is executed, you can use the `tearDown()` method to clean up or release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def setUp(self):\n",
    "        self.test_data = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "    def tearDown(self):\n",
    "        del self.test_data\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_sum(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(sum(self.test_data), 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    unittest.main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`setUp()`**: Called before each test method.\n",
    "- **`tearDown()`**: Called after each test method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Test Fixtures**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `setUp` and `tearDown`, you can create test fixtures, which are pieces of reusable code that prepare data or resources required by your tests. You can define custom test fixtures that can be used across different test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of fixture setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class TestDatabase(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def setUpClass(cls):\n",
    "        # This runs once before all tests in the class\n",
    "        print(\"Setting up the database connection\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def tearDownClass(cls):\n",
    "        # This runs once after all tests in the class\n",
    "        print(\"Closing the database connection\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def setUp(self):\n",
    "        # This runs before each test method\n",
    "        print(\"Setting up test data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def tearDown(self):\n",
    "        # This runs after each test method\n",
    "        print(\"Cleaning up test data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_insert(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Running insert test\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_delete(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Running delete test\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`setUpClass()`**: Class-level setup (runs once before all tests).\n",
    "- **`tearDownClass()`**: Class-level teardown (runs once after all tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Grouping Tests: Test Suites**\n",
    "\n",
    "In `unittest`, tests can be grouped together into **test suites** for better organization. A test suite is a collection of test cases that can be run together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_addition(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_subtraction(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(10 - 5, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "def suite():\n",
    "    suite = unittest.TestSuite()\n",
    "    suite.addTest(TestMathOperations('test_addition'))\n",
    "    suite.addTest(TestMathOperations('test_subtraction'))\n",
    "    return suite\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()\n",
    "    runner.run(suite())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Suite**: You can define a suite of tests that can be run together.\n",
    "- **TextTestRunner**: The test runner that runs the suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Running Tests from the Command Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run `unittest` tests using the command line. By default, it looks for files starting with `test_` and methods starting with `test_` in those files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m unittest test_module.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running all tests**: If you have multiple test modules (files), you can run all tests in the directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m unittest discover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specify a directory**: Use the `-s` option to specify the directory containing your tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m unittest discover -s tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running specific tests**: To run a specific test method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m unittest test_module.TestClass.test_method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Advanced Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Skipping Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may want to skip a test under certain conditions. You can use the `@unittest.skip` decorator to skip a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    @unittest.skip(\"Skipping this test\")\n",
    "    def test_example(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Expected Failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can mark a test as expected to fail using the `@unittest.expectedFailure` decorator. This is useful when you're testing known issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    @unittest.expectedFailure\n",
    "    def test_example(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 3)  # This will fail as expected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Test Case Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `@unittest.skipIf()` or `@unittest.skipUnless()` decorators to skip tests based on specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    @unittest.skipIf(condition=True, reason=\"Condition met\")\n",
    "    def test_example(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Test Reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "`unittest` provides a basic test runner that outputs test results to the console. You can customize the output using a **TextTestRunner** or by creating custom reporters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of generating a report:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyTestClass(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_example(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(unittest.defaultTestLoader.loadTestsFromTest\n",
    "\n",
    "Case(MyTestClass))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`verbosity=2`**: Makes the test runner output more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `unittest` module is a robust and powerful testing framework built into Python. It follows the xUnit style of testing and provides a range of features for creating unit tests and managing test execution. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assertions** for validating test outcomes.\n",
