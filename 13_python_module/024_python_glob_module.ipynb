    "### **Python `glob` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `glob` module in Python is used for file name pattern matching, which allows users to retrieve files and directories that match specific patterns. It is commonly used for file searching, such as retrieving files with certain extensions, searching for files in directories, or recursively fetching files in subdirectories. The `glob` module is part of Python's standard library and offers an easy way to work with filenames using wildcards, like `*`, `?`, and `[]`, that are typically used in shell scripting.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of the `glob` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The primary purpose of the `glob` module is to provide file name matching capabilities using wildcards or glob patterns. These patterns are used to match specific files in directories based on their names or extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wildcards in Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The following wildcard characters can be used in glob patterns:\n",
    "     - `*`: Matches any number of characters, including zero characters. For example, `*.txt` matches all files with the `.txt` extension.\n",
    "     - `?`: Matches exactly one character. For example, `file?.txt` will match files like `file1.txt` or `fileA.txt`, but not `file.txt`.\n",
    "     - `[]`: Matches a single character within the specified set or range. For example, `file[1-3].txt` will match `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `glob` module can also match files recursively through subdirectories using the `**` wildcard, which is supported in Python 3.5 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Searching for files with specific extensions in a directory (e.g., find all `.txt` files).\n",
    "   - Finding files that match certain patterns, such as all files starting with a specific prefix.\n",
    "   - Handling file operations based on patterns, such as deleting, moving, or processing multiple files that match a given pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `glob` module is a part of Pythonâ€™s standard library, so it does not need to be installed separately. You can directly import it in your script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Usage of the `glob` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function provided by the `glob` module is `glob.glob()`, which retrieves a list of file paths that match a given pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Basic Pattern Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve files matching a simple pattern, use `glob()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve all .txt files in the current directory\n",
    "files = glob.glob('*.txt')\n",
    "print(files)  # List of .txt files in the current directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `*.txt` matches all files in the current directory that end with the `.txt` extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Using Wildcards:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use wildcards to match more complex file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve all files starting with 'data' and ending with .csv\n",
    "files = glob.glob('data*.csv')\n",
    "print(files)  # e.g., ['data1.csv', 'dataA.csv', 'dataB.csv']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data*.csv` will match files like `data1.csv`, `dataA.csv`, etc., but not `report.csv` or `file.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Using `?` for Single Character Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `?` to match exactly one character in a file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Match files like 'file1.txt', 'fileA.txt', etc.\n",
    "files = glob.glob('file?.txt')\n",
    "print(files)  # ['file1.txt', 'fileA.txt']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Using `[]` for Character Ranges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use square brackets `[]` to specify a set or range of characters to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Match files like 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt'\n",
    "files = glob.glob('file[1-3].txt')\n",
    "print(files)  # ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Searching in Subdirectories:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `glob` only matches files in the specified directory and does not search subdirectories. To search recursively, you can use `**` in the pattern (available in Python 3.5+), along with the `recursive=True` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursively find all .txt files in the current directory and its subdirectories\n",
    "files = glob.glob('**/*.txt', recursive=True)\n",
    "print(files)  # e.g., ['dir1/file1.txt', 'dir2/file2.txt', 'file3.txt']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will search through all subdirectories for `.txt` files, including files in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Functions in the `glob` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`glob.iglob()` (Iterator Version of `glob()`):**\n",
    "   - `glob.iglob()` returns an iterator instead of a list, which can be more memory-efficient for large directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using iglob() to get an iterator for .txt files\n",
    "for file in glob.iglob('*.txt'):\n",
    "    print(file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is helpful when dealing with large numbers of files because it does not load all results into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`glob.escape()` (Escaping Special Characters):**\n",
    "   - If you need to match literal special characters (like `*`, `?`, or `[`), you can use `glob.escape()` to escape those characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Escape special characters and use them in a pattern\n",
    "escaped_pattern = glob.escape('file[1-3].txt')\n",
    "print(escaped_pattern)  # Output: 'file[1\\-3]\\.txt'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when you need to search for filenames that contain characters that would otherwise be interpreted as wildcards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding Files with Specific Extensions:**\n",
    "   - You can use `glob` to find files with a certain extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.txt`, `.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find all .csv files in the current directory\n",
    "csv_files = glob.glob('*.csv')\n",
    "print(csv_files)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Multiple Files:**\n",
    "   - After finding files, you can process them by iterating over the matched results, such as opening and reading files, performing operations, or renaming files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process all .txt files\n",
    "for txt_file in glob.glob('*.txt'):\n",
    "    with open(txt_file, 'r') as f:\n",
    "        data = f.read()\n",
    "    print(f\"Contents of {txt_file}: {data}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Search in a Directory:**\n",
    "   - To find files in subdirectories, `glob` allows for easy recursive searching, such as when you need to process files within nested folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursively find all image files in subdirectories\n",
    "image_files = glob.glob('**/*.jpg', recursive=True)\n",
    "print(image_files)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages of Using `glob`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The `glob` module provides a simple interface for file pattern matching without requiring complex regular expressions or manual file iteration.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The module works across different platforms, ensuring compatibility with Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows.\n",
    "- **Recursive Searching:** Starting from Python 3.5, `glob` supports recursive searching, allowing you to search through directories and subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations of the `glob` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Pattern Matching:** `glob` uses simple pattern matching with wildcards. If you need more complex matching logic (e.g., regular expressions), you may need to use the `re` module in combination with `glob`.\n",
    "- **Performance:** While efficient for smaller directories, `glob` can become slower for very large directories or when handling millions of files, as it needs to check every file in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `glob` module is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for pattern-based file searching in Python. It allows you to search for files using wildcards, handles recursive searches, and supports multiple file operations such as reading and processing files. Whether you're working with a few files or need to search across nested directories, `glob` provides a simple and effective solution for your file management needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is particularly useful in scripts that need to handle a variety of file operations based on matching filenames or extensions, making it an essential tool for tasks like file processing, automation, and batch operations.\n"
