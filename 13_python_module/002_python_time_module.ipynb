    "### **Python `time` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `time` module in Python provides a variety of time-related functions, such as working with the current time, measuring time intervals, and manipulating time representations. It is one of the most frequently used modules when dealing with time and performance-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `time` module works with Unix timestamps (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970) and provides functions that help you interact with this time format, perform conversions, and control the flow of time in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of the `time` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Working with Time in Seconds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In many parts of the `time` module, time is represented in seconds (or fractions of a second). For example, `time.time()` returns the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Time in Python is often represented as a floating-point number where the integer part represents seconds, and the fractional part represents fractions of a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Formatting and Parsing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The module provides functions to format time as human-readable strings and to parse strings back into structured time representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Measurement:**\n",
    "   - The `time` module is useful for measuring elapsed time, benchmarking code performance, and adding delays in code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Commonly Used Functions in the `time` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Getting the Current Time:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.time()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (Jan 1, 1970).\n",
    "  - This is useful for measuring time intervals or getting the current timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import time\n",
    "  current_time = time.time()\n",
    "  print(current_time)  # Output: A floating point number representing the current timestamp\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.localtime([secs])`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Converts a time in seconds since the epoch to a struct_time in local time. If `secs` is not provided, it uses the current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  local_time = time.localtime()\n",
    "  print(local_time)  # Output: struct_time object\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.gmtime([secs])`**:\n",
    "  - Converts a time in seconds since the epoch to a struct_time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  utc_time = time.gmtime()\n",
    "  print(utc_time)  # Output: struct_time object\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Formatting Time:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.strftime(format[, t])`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Converts a `struct_time` to a string as per the provided format string. The `t` argument is optional and defaults to the current time if not provided.\n",
    "  - Common format codes:\n",
    "    - `%Y` – Year (4 digits)\n",
    "    - `%m` – Month (2 digits)\n",
    "    - `%d` – Day (2 digits)\n",
    "    - `%H` – Hour (24-hour format)\n",
    "    - `%M` – Minute (2 digits)\n",
    "    - `%S` – Second (2 digits)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  formatted_time = time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", time.localtime())\n",
    "  print(formatted_time)  # Output: Formatted string, e.g., '2025-03-25 12:45:30'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.asctime([t])`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Converts a `struct_time` to a string representing the time in a human-readable format.\n",
    "  - If no argument is passed, it uses the current local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ascii_time = time.asctime()\n",
    "  print(ascii_time)  # Output: 'Mon Mar 25 12:45:30 2025'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.ctime([secs])`**:\n",
    "  - Converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing the local time.\n",
    "  - Similar to `time.asctime()`, but takes a timestamp as input.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  timestamp = time.time()\n",
    "  print(time.ctime(timestamp))  # Output: 'Mon Mar 25 12:45:30 2025'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Time Manipulation and Conversion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.mktime(t)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Converts a `struct_time` in local time to seconds since the epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  local_time = time.localtime()\n",
    "  timestamp = time.mktime(local_time)\n",
    "  print(timestamp)  # Output: A timestamp (seconds since epoch)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.sleep(seconds)`**:\n",
    "  - Suspends the execution of the current program for the specified number of seconds. Useful for adding delays in programs.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(\"Start\")\n",
    "  time.sleep(2)\n",
    "  print(\"End after 2 seconds\")  # Output: \"Start\", then after 2 seconds, \"End after 2 seconds\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Performance Measurement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.perf_counter()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Returns the value of a performance counter, which is typically used to measure short durations. It provides the highest available resolution timer to measure time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  start = time.perf_counter()\n",
    "  # Your code here...\n",
    "  end = time.perf_counter()\n",
    "  print(f\"Elapsed time: {end - start} seconds\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.process_time()`**:\n",
    "  - Returns the processor time (CPU time) in seconds, which is useful for measuring the CPU time consumed by a program.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  start = time.process_time()\n",
    "  # Code to measure CPU time\n",
    "  end = time.process_time()\n",
    "  print(f\"CPU Time: {end - start} seconds\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Working with Time Zones:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.tzname`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Returns a tuple containing the names of the time zones used for local time and daylight saving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(time.tzname)  # Output: ('Standard Time', 'Daylight Saving Time')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time.altzone`**:\n",
    "  - The number of seconds west of UTC for the time zone that is used during daylight saving time.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(time.altzone)  # Output: Number of seconds west of UTC during DST\n",
    "  ```\n",
