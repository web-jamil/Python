    "### **Python `datetime` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` module in Python provides classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. It allows you to work with dates, times, and time intervals, and convert between different formats. This module is essential for handling and formatting date and time data, performing arithmetic on date objects, and working with time zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` module is part of Python's standard library and contains several classes and functions for handling and formatting dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of the `datetime` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Datetime Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `datetime` module provides a way to represent dates and times as objects, allowing you to store, manipulate, and perform arithmetic with date and time values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Timezone Awareness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `datetime` allows you to create \"naive\" and \"aware\" datetime objects. Naive datetime objects are unaware of time zones, while aware datetime objects include time zone information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Arithmetic:**\n",
    "   - The module allows you to perform arithmetic with `timedelta` objects, enabling date and time manipulation (e.g., adding or subtracting days, hours, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Classes and Functions in the `datetime` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **The `datetime` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` class combines both date and time components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond) into a single object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datetime.datetime(year, month, day[, hour, minute, second, microsecond, tzinfo])`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A `datetime` object represents both date and time.\n",
    "  - It can be created with the specified year, month, day, and optional hour, minute, second, microsecond, and time zone information (`tzinfo`).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import datetime\n",
    "  dt = datetime.datetime(2025, 3, 25, 12, 45, 30)\n",
    "  print(dt)  # Output: 2025-03-25 12:45:30\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing the Components:**\n",
    "  - You can access the individual components of the `datetime` object (e.g., year, month, day, hour, etc.) using attributes:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(dt.year)   # Output: 2025\n",
    "  print(dt.month)  # Output: 3\n",
    "  print(dt.day)    # Output: 25\n",
    "  print(dt.hour)   # Output: 12\n",
    "  print(dt.minute) # Output: 45\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **The `date` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `date` class represents the date without the time component (year, month, and day).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datetime.date(year, month, day)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You can create a `date` object with a specific year, month, and day.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  d = datetime.date(2025, 3, 25)\n",
    "  print(d)  # Output: 2025-03-25\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing the Components:**\n",
    "  - Similar to `datetime`, you can access the individual components of the `date` object (year, month, and day).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(d.year)  # Output: 2025\n",
    "  print(d.month) # Output: 3\n",
    "  print(d.day)   # Output: 25\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **The `time` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `time` class represents a time value (hour, minute, second, and microsecond), without a date component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datetime.time(hour, minute, second, microsecond)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A `time` object can be created with specified hour, minute, second, and microsecond.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  t = datetime.time(12, 45, 30)\n",
    "  print(t)  # Output: 12:45:30\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing the Components:**\n",
    "  - You can access the individual components of the `time` object (hour, minute, second, and microsecond).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(t.hour)   # Output: 12\n",
    "  print(t.minute) # Output: 45\n",
    "  print(t.second) # Output: 30\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **The `timedelta` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timedelta` class represents a difference between two dates or times, allowing you to perform arithmetic on `datetime` and `date` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datetime.timedelta(days, seconds, microseconds)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You can create a `timedelta` object with specified days, seconds, and microseconds, and perform date/time arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  delta = datetime.timedelta(days=5, hours=3, minutes=30)\n",
    "  print(delta)  # Output: 5 days, 3:30:00\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arithmetic with `timedelta`:**\n",
    "  - You can add or subtract `timedelta` objects to/from `datetime` or `date` objects.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  today = datetime.date(2025, 3, 25)\n",
    "  new_date = today + datetime.timedelta(days=5)\n",
    "  print(new_date)  # Output: 2025-03-30\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **The `timezone` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timezone` class represents a fixed offset from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), enabling timezone-aware datetime objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datetime.timezone(offset)`**:\n",
    "  - Create a `timezone` object with a specific offset (e.g., UTC+1, UTC-5).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  tz = datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=3))\n",
    "  dt = datetime.datetime(2025, 3, 25, 12, 45, 30, tzinfo=tz)\n",
    "  print(dt)  # Output: 2025-03-25 12:45:30+03:00\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Functions in the `datetime` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`datetime.now(tz=None)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns the current local date and time as a `datetime` object.\n",
    "- If the optional `tz` argument is passed, it returns a timezone-aware `datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "now = datetime.datetime.now()\n",
    "print(now)  # Output: Current local date and time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`datetime.today()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns the current local date and time as a `datetime` object. This is equivalent to `datetime.now()` but without the `tz` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "today = datetime.datetime.today()\n",
    "print(today)  # Output: Current local date and time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`datetime.utcnow()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns the current UTC date and time as a `datetime` object.\n",

    "print(utc_now)  # Output: Current UTC date and time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **`datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=None)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts a POSIX timestamp (the number of seconds since the Unix epoch) into a `datetime` object in local time.\n",
    "- Optionally, a `tz` argument can be provided to create an aware `datetime` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "timestamp = 1609459200  # Example timestamp (Jan 1, 2021)\n",
    "dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)\n",
    "print(dt)  # Output: 2021-01-01 00:00:00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **`datetime.strptime(date_string, format)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parses a string representing a date and time into a `datetime` object using the provided format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(\"2025-03-25 12:45:30\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n",
    "print(dt)  # Output: 2025-03-25 12:45:30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **`datetime.strftime(format)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formats a `datetime` object as a string according to the given format string.\n",

    "### **Practical Use Cases of the `datetime` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Dates and Times:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `datetime` is essential for storing and manipulating date and time information. It is widely used in applications such as event scheduling, logging, and timestamping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Zone Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - With the `timezone` class and timezone-aware `datetime` objects, you can handle applications that need to operate in different time zones (e.g., international applications, scheduling events).\n",
