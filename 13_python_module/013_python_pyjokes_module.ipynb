    "### **Python `pyjokes` Module: Overview, Concepts, and Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pyjokes` module is a simple Python library that provides a collection of jokes that can be easily integrated into Python applications. It is particularly useful for adding fun, humor, or a lighthearted touch to projects and scripts. The jokes are typically in the form of short one-liners, puns, and humorous questions and answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module is often used for testing purposes (to display humorous content in mockups, demos, or development environments) or in applications aimed at entertainment, relaxation, or stress relief.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of the `pyjokes` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Joke Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `pyjokes` module generates jokes based on a set of predefined joke categories. It retrieves jokes from a variety of joke types such as \"general,\" \"programming,\" and \"knock-knock\" jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Joke Categories:**\n",
    "   - The jokes can be retrieved from different categories, making it versatile for a variety of audiences. The available categories are:\n",
    "     - **\"general\":** Jokes that are suitable for all audiences.\n",
    "     - **\"programming\":** Jokes related to programming and software development. These jokes are often humorous to those familiar with coding.\n",
    "     - **\"knock-knock\":** Classic \"knock-knock\" jokes.\n",
    "     - **\"neutral\":** A category for jokes that are not inappropriate but are considered to have a neutral tone.\n",
    "3. **Internationalization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `pyjokes` module supports multiple languages. By default, it provides jokes in English, but you can switch to other languages (e.g., German, Spanish, French) for a localized experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random Joke Generation:**\n",
    "   - The module randomly selects a joke from the chosen category. It is designed to return a single joke when called, which can be displayed to the user or used in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important Functions in the `pyjokes` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`pyjokes.get_joke(language='en', category='general')`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:** The `get_joke` function retrieves a random joke from the specified language and category. You can specify the language (e.g., \"en\" for English) and category (e.g., \"general,\" \"programming,\" \"knock-knock\") to filter the joke selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `language`: A string indicating the language of the joke. Default is 'en' (English).\n",
    "  - `category`: A string indicating the type of joke to retrieve. Default is 'general'. Other valid values are 'programming', 'knock-knock', and 'neutral'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pyjokes\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Get a random joke in English from the \"general\" category\n",
    "  joke = pyjokes.get_joke(language='en', category='general')\n",
    "  print(joke)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Get a random programming joke in Spanish\n",
    "  joke = pyjokes.get_joke(language='es', category='programming')\n",
    "  print(joke)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```text\n",
    "  Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`pyjokes.get_jokes(language='en', category='general')`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:** This function is similar to `get_joke`, but instead of returning a single joke, it returns a list of jokes from the specified category and language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `language`: The language of the jokes. Default is 'en' (English).\n",
    "  - `category`: The category of jokes to retrieve. Can be 'general', 'programming', 'knock-knock', or 'neutral'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pyjokes\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Get a list of 3 random jokes in English from the \"programming\" category\n",
    "  jokes = pyjokes.get_jokes(language='en', category='programming')\n",
    "  for joke in jokes:\n",
    "      print(joke)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```text\n",
    "  Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs.\n",
    "  Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can’t C#.\n",
    "  What’s a programmer’s favorite hangout place? The Foo Bar.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`pyjokes.get_joke_list(language='en', category='general')`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:** This function is an extension of the `get_jokes()` function and returns a list of jokes in the form of strings. It can be used to retrieve multiple jokes from a specific category or language.\n",
