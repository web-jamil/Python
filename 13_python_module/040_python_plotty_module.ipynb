    "The `plotly` module in Python is a powerful and interactive data visualization library used for creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive plots. Plotly is widely used in data science, analytics, and data-driven web applications for producing visually appealing and interactive visualizations. It integrates well with web-based frameworks like Dash, and it can generate graphs in various formats including 2D and 3D plots, maps, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Plotly in your Python projects, you'll first need to install it. You can install Plotly using Pythonâ€™s package manager, `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install plotly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Core Concepts of Plotly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key concepts and components of Plotly that will help you understand its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Plotly Graph Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly's graphing system is based on **graph objects** (`go`). The most common object used is `go.Figure`, which represents a complete plot. This object can contain multiple traces (i.e., datasets), and each trace can represent a specific type of plot (e.g., scatter, bar, line).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Traces**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **trace** represents a single visualization element, such as a line, bar, or scatter plot. A plot can contain multiple traces that together form the complete visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common types of traces include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scatter plots** (`go.Scatter`): Points or lines on a 2D plane.\n",
    "- **Bar charts** (`go.Bar`): Vertical or horizontal bars to represent data.\n",
    "- **Pie charts** (`go.Pie`): Circular charts divided into slices representing proportions.\n",
    "- **Heatmaps** (`go.Heatmap`): 2D grid of colors representing values in a matrix.\n",
    "- **3D plots** (`go.Scatter3d`, `go.Surface`): 3D scatter and surface plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **layout** in Plotly defines the visual appearance of a plot, such as axis labels, title, legend position, background color, and so on. The `go.Layout` object is used to customize the layout of a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Figure**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Figure** is the combination of the data (traces) and the layout. The `go.Figure()` class is used to create a figure, and it holds the traces and layout configuration. It is the final object that gets rendered as a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Plotly Express**\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Express is a high-level interface built on top of `plotly.graph_objects` for creating plots with less code. It provides a simple syntax and is great for quick visualizations. Commonly used for creating scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Interactivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly plots are interactive by default, meaning users can zoom, pan, and hover to view details. Plotly also allows adding interactive features such as buttons, sliders, and dropdowns to control the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Core Functions of Plotly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore the core functionalities and how to use Plotly in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Basic Plotly Plot Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a basic plot in Plotly, we need to import the necessary modules and create traces and layout objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Creating a Simple Scatter Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create data (trace)\n",
    "trace = go.Scatter(\n",
    "    x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n",
    "    y=[10, 11, 12, 13, 14],\n",
    "    mode='lines+markers',  # Display both lines and markers\n",
    "    name='Line 1'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create layout (for customizing the appearance)\n",
    "layout = go.Layout(\n",
    "    title=\"Simple Plotly Scatter Plot\",\n",
    "    xaxis=dict(title='X Axis'),\n",
    "    yaxis=dict(title='Y Axis')\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the figure\n",
    "fig = go.Figure(data=[trace], layout=layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the figure\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We create a **trace** using `go.Scatter()`, which is a simple scatter plot (with both lines and markers).\n",
    "- We define a **layout** using `go.Layout()`, where we customize the axis labels and the title.\n",
    "- The **figure** is created using `go.Figure()`, combining the trace and layout.\n",
    "- Finally, we call `fig.show()` to render the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Plotly Express for Quick Visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Express simplifies the syntax for creating plots. It automatically handles the creation of traces and layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Simple Scatter Plot with Plotly Express\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.express as px\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample dataset\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n",
    "    'Y': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a plot using Plotly Express\n",
    "fig = px.scatter(data, x='X', y='Y', title=\"Simple Scatter Plot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the figure\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use `plotly.express.scatter()` to create a scatter plot.\n",
    "- The data is passed in as a dictionary (you can use data from `pandas` DataFrames as well).\n",
    "- Plotly Express automatically handles the creation of traces and layout for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Multiple Traces in a Plot**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can include multiple traces in a single plot, such as adding another scatter plot to the same figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Multiple Traces\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "\n",
    "# First trace\n",
    "trace1 = go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[10, 11, 12, 13], mode='lines', name='Trace 1')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second trace\n",
    "trace2 = go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[15, 16, 17, 18], mode='markers', name='Trace 2')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the figure with both traces\n",
    "fig = go.Figure(data=[trace1, trace2])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the figure\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a figure with two traces: one that represents a line plot and another that represents a scatter plot with markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. 3D Plots**\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly allows creating 3D plots such as scatter plots and surface plots. For example, you can create a 3D scatter plot using `go.Scatter3d()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: 3D Scatter Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a 3D scatter plot trace\n",
    "trace = go.Scatter3d(\n",
    "    x=[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "    y=[10, 11, 12, 13],\n",
    "    z=[14, 15, 16, 17],\n",
    "    mode='markers',\n",
    "    marker=dict(size=12, color='blue')\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create layout\n",
    "layout = go.Layout(title=\"3D Scatter Plot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the figure\n",
    "fig = go.Figure(data=[trace], layout=layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Creating Subplots**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create multiple plots in a single figure (subplots). The `make_subplots()` function is used to define the layout of the subplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Subplots\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "from plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create subplots\n",
    "fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add scatter plot in the first subplot\n",
    "fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[10, 11, 12]), row=1, col=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add bar chart in the second subplot\n",
    "fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=['A', 'B', 'C'], y=[5, 10, 15]), row=1, col=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the figure\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Customizing Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize various aspects of the plot, such as axis titles, background color, margins, and more, by modifying the layout properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Usage: Customizing Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create data (trace)\n",
    "trace = go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[10, 11, 12])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create layout with customization\n",
    "layout = go.Layout(\n",
    "    title=\"Customized Plot\",\n",
    "    xaxis=dict(title='Custom X Axis', showgrid=False),\n",
    "    yaxis=dict(title='Custom Y Axis', showgrid=False),\n",
    "    plot_bgcolor='rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)',  # transparent background\n",
    "    paper_bgcolor='rgb(255, 255, 255)'  # white paper background\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the figure\n",
    "fig = go.Figure(data=[trace], layout=layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
